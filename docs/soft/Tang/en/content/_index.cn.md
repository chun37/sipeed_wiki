# Tang Primer Docs

Tang Primer, an extremely polished domestic open source RISC-V development board.

Litchi sugar was born in the tide of domestic chip oscillations. After three months of growth and transformation, it finally reached the stage of open source in July 2018.

Litchi sugar not only takes on the expectations of open source developers, but also promotes the development and education related to RISC-V architecture in China, and introduces an excellent development board in China to the world.
